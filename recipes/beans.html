    <h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
    <p>Plantain and beans, also known as "Red Red," is a popular dish in several West African countries.
        Being Ghanaian, I ate this a lot growing up. This dish is essentially stewed black-eyed peas with fried plantains.
        It is very delicious and makes for a great lunch or dinner.
        Meal prepping with this dish is also super easy and it reheats well!

    <p>
        The stewed beans are traditionally made with palm nut oil extracted from the palm fruit and not to be confused
         with palm kernel oil extracted from the seed. 
        This palm oil usually gives the beans their traditional, red-orangey-yellow hue
